        <h2>Will Lewthwaite</h2>
        <h3>Student, Artist, Musician, Photographer</h3>
        <p>I have worked in a variety of professions and that has provided a wealth of knowledge and experience.
          In 2020 I returned to school to build on that experience with new skills that I can apply towards a career in
          design and media.
          This webpage is a work in progress. As I learn new things the design will also improve.</p>
        <p>I live in the Comox Valley with my wife and our cat. I enjoy music, art, history, nature, and science.
          I play guitar, percussion, and some keyboards. I do a lot of home recording, and as a hobby I create videos
          for my YouTube channel<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxy8o0J-DcobOQG56dG_FbA"
            target="_blank">Weathered Oak Media</a>.</p>

          <h3>BC 30,000 BC</h3>
          <p>As a term project in FIN 100 Art History, students were asked to analyze and critique a work of art from a
            period of histrory
            within the textbook and then come up with their own creative response in whatever form. I chose the artwork
            seen in prehistoric
            cave drawings found in France that are estimated to be well over 30,000 years old. My creative response was
            in two parts:
            I created a large drawing in the style and method of the ancient artists and produced a video documenting
            the
            entire project. This involved research, voice-over recordings, and even composing and recording the
            soundtrack.
